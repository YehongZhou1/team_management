# team_management
Open the page http://127.0.0.1:8000/team/, which is the main page of the app.

The initial view is like this:

Since we haven't added any member, it shows 0 member in team now.

We try to add the first member by clicking 'add' button.

This is the add page.

We type in corresponding information, and there is a validator for every field, if incorrect information is entered, an error message will pop up.

We choose to creat an admin member first so we choose Admin for role and click the submit button, the page is redirected to home page,

Now we try to add the second member with regular role:

As you can see, there is a '(Admin)' text near the name of admin member.

Then we try to edit the info of the second member. We want to change his phone number and his role.

We click that member and then we enter the edit page:

We change these fields and click submit button:

The info is changed.

Then we try to delete the first member. Also we click this member and enter the edit page.

<img width="588" alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-10 at 1 57 44 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109248593/218206581-d75791d1-1890-4ddb-a807-484a5075c003.png">

Since this is an admin member, we cannot delete his info and the delete button is disabled.

In order to change this, we edit his role into regular member.

Now we can delete this member.

<img width="588" alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-10 at 1 59 28 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109248593/218206878-ca8b958e-2edc-40f3-b58d-0a33d3666013.png">

There is only one member left in the home page.
